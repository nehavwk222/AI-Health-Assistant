AI Health Assistant üè•

AI Health Assistant is a web-based AI chatbot that provides general health advice using state-of-the-art NLP models from Hugging Face. This project demonstrates Python programming, AI/ML, NLP, and web deployment skills with a clean, interactive interface built using Gradio.

Key Features

Ask general health questions and get AI-generated responses.

Responsive and modern UI using Gradio with custom CSS.

Uses microsoft/phi-1.5 model from Hugging Face for natural language understanding.

Runs locally or can generate a public link for sharing.

Easily extensible for more health-specific functionalities.

Project Demo

Local Deployment:
Run the app locally and open the URL printed in the terminal, e.g.:
http://127.0.0.1:7862

Public Link: Optional, generated by Gradio using share=True.
